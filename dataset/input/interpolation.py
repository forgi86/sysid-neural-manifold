        If using `LinearInterpolation` as part of a [`diffrax.ControlTerm`][], then the
        vector field will make a jump every time one of the knots `ts` is passed. If
        using an adaptive step size controller such as [`diffrax.PIDController`][],
        then this means the controller should be informed about the jumps, so that it
        can handle them appropriately:

        ```python
        ts = ...
        interp = LinearInterpolation(ts=ts, ...)
        term = ControlTerm(..., control=interp)
        stepsize_controller = PIDController(..., jump_ts=ts)

        **Arguments:**

        - `t0`: Any point in $[t_0, t_1]$ to evaluate the interpolation at.
        - `t1`: If passed, then the increment from `t1` to `t0` is evaluated instead.
        - `left`: Across jump points: whether to treat the path as left-continuous
            or right-continuous. [In practice linear interpolation is always continuous
            except around `NaN`s.]

            Note that we use $t_0$ and $t_1$ to refer to the overall interval, as
            obtained via `instance.t0` and `instance.t1`. We use `t0` and `t1` to refer
            to some subinterval of $[t_0, t_1]$. This is an API that is used for
            consistency with the rest of the package, and just happens to be a little
            confusing here.

        **Returns:**

        If `t1` is not passed:

        The interpolation of the data. Suppose $t_j < t < t_{j+1}$, where $t$ is `t0`
        and $t_j$ and $t_{j+1}$ are some element of `ts` as passed in `__init__`.
        Then the value returned is
        $y_j + (y_{j+1} - y_j)\frac{t - t_j}{t_{j+1} - t_j}$.

        If `t1` is passed:

        As above, with $t$ taken to be both `t0` and `t1`, and the increment between
        them returned.
